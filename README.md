# Order-and-Chaos

Project for the Software Development Exam @ UniTS. \
This repository consists a Java implementation of 
the board game [Order and Chaos](https://www.bing.com/search?q=order+and+chaos+wikipedia&qs=NWU&pq=order+and+chaos+wikipedia&sc=1-25&cvid=2145A6DEB3EF4BDCB356A085CC2A0311&FORM=QBRE&sp=1).

## Rules

Order and Chaos is a variant of the game tic-tac-toe on a 6Ã—6 gameboard.\
The player Order strives to create a five-in-a-row of either Xs or Os, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.\
Chaos, on the other hand, endeavors to prevent this. \
Order plays first, then turns alternate.\
Six-in-a-row does not qualify as a win.
